# Psyanim Core Usage Examples

Psyanim Core comes with a growing library of AI Steering Behavior components and various utility functions which you can reuse to build your own experiments.

The purpose of this section of the docs is to provide a collection of examples of how to use the existing Psyanim Core components, as well as how to leverage them for more advanced use-cases.

Each example consists of a walkthrough showing how to build a scene and/or components with specific features relevant to that example.

To use these scenes and/or components, you'll need to create a project using Psyanim-CLI.  From there, each example assumes you are working from an existing project.

Please refer to the [Hello Psyanim 2.0](/hello_psyanim_2.md) tutorial to see how to create a new project using Psyanim-CLI and add scenes & components to it.
