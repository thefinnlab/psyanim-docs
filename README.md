# Psyanim 2.0 - Introduction and Overview

`Psyanim 2.0` is a tool for rapid design, prototyping and deployment of psychology research experiments involving 2D procedural game AI & animation.

In order to create experiments with different `Psyanim` scenes and agent behaviors, a basic understanding of Javascript is recommended, but not beyond what is required to use [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/).

To extend Psyanim with new functionality or AI behavior algorithms, an intermediate level of comfort with Javascript is recommended.

The `Quick Start` tutorials will get you up and running with a basic Javascript background.

The `Psyanim In-Depth` tutorials are only necessary if you plan on extending Psyanim with new functionality or AI behavior algorithms.
