# TODO: AI Steering Behaviors quick start

## Keep this short and sweet!

This section should describe the steering architecture in Psyanim 2.0, including the distinction between 'Behavior' and 'Agent' components, and why that was necessary to support reusing `Behavior` components across multiple `Agent` types... will help with future behavior development.

Should also be a brief overview of how to use steering behaviors in general.  Maybe through a simple example that also points people to the API docs.
