## 1. Overview and Project Setup

Sometimes, an experiment may not require any control input from the user and is designed to only be observed passively.

In these instances, researchers have even more control over the quality and types of agent-based animations that are presented to the user, since many stochastic simulations can be generated offline and hand-picked for quality control before experiments are deployed.
