## 1. Overview of Psyanim Database Schema

`Psyanim 2` is designed primarily for online `psychology` and `cognitive science` experiments, so an important part of each experiment is data gathering and recording.

As `PsyanimApp` is responsible solely for simulating and rendering the 2D scenes we create, all of the data gathering and recording responsibilities are handled by the `PsyanimJsPsychPlugin`.

The data generated by `Psyanim 2` exists in the form of a NoSQL database: `collections` of `JSON documents` where each `document` contains a single `JSON object` as it's root.

These `Psyanim 2 databases` can exist locally as `flat files` or in the `cloud` via any database provider.

By default, `Psyanim 2` has tight integration with `Google Firebase`, but a simple abstraction layer exists so support can be added for other cloud-based databases.

There are 5 top-level collections in the database:

- `trial-metadata`
- `animation-clips`
- `state-logs`
- `session-logs`
- `jspsych-experiment-data`

Every `document` in these `collections` contains a `JSON object` as its root, and within each top-level object are two fields: `data` and a `timestamp`.

The `data` field of the top-level JSON object contains the actual data for that specific document type.

The `trial-metadata` collection contains a document for every trial that is run using the `PsyanimJsPsychPlugin`.

The `animation-clips` collection contains a document for every entity whose `position`, `rotation`, and any other time-varying property was recorded.

The `state-logs` collection retains a configurable history of `agent states` from the AI state machines which control the AI agents.

The `session-logs` collection contains all of the `PsyanimDebug logging output`.

The `jspsych-experiment-data` contains the contents of the `jsPsych.data` structure captured by any trial that had a `PsyanimJsPsychDataWriterExtension` added to it.

In the sections that follow, each collection is described in more detail.

## 2. `trial-metadata` collection

The `trial-metadata` collection documents all contain scene specific data, including:

- a `sceneKey` identifying the unique scene name for the trial
- an `agentMetadata` array, containing metadata for each agent, possibly including user-defined custom parameters for each agent
- some `sceneParameters`, some of which are user-defined and some are defined by `psyanim2`
- a `trialNumber` integer that uniquely identifies that trial within all of the trials run with the `PsyanimJsPsychPlugin` for that experiment
- a user-defined `userID` string
- a user-defined `experimentName` string

Any entity in `psyanim2` can have it's position and orientation saved over time as a document in the `animation-clips` collection.

Each object in the `agentMetadata` array can potentially have an `animationClipId`, which is a document ID for a document in the `animation-clips` containing the `animation data` for that `agent`.

The following is a sample `trial-metadata` document:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "sceneKey": "Wander Test",
        "agentMetadata": [
            {
                "animationClipId": "4b2bc253-c434-4b8c-8aab-00f92eec36b9",
                "name": "agent",

                "matterOptions": {
                    "name": "agent",
                    "isSleeping": false,
                    "isSensor": false,
                    "collisionFilter": {
                        "category": 1,
                        "mask": 13
                    }
                },
                "shapeParams": {
                    "shapeType": "PSYANIM_SHAPE_TRIANGLE",
                    "altitude": 32,
                    "color": 16761035,
                    "textureKey": "wanderTestTexture",
                    "base": 16
                }
            }
        ],
        "sceneParameters": [
            {
                "parameterType": "scene",
                "parameterName": "canvasSize",
                "parameterValue": {
                    "width": 800,
                    "height": 600
                }
            },
            {
                "parameterType": "scene",
                "parameterName": "backgroundColor",
                "parameterValue": "#ffffff"
            },
            {
                "parameterType": "scene",
                "parameterName": "wrapScreenBoundary",
                "parameterValue": true
            }
        ],
        "trialNumber": 0,
        "sessionID": "bea6e389-5ae5-47f4-9235-4b221d8ff7f3",
        "userID": "Jason",
        "experimentName": "defaultExperimentName"
    },
    "time": {
        "_seconds": 1701914763,
        "_nanoseconds": 233000000
    }
}
```

## 3. `animation-clips` collection

Every document `animation-clips` collection contains a `time-series` array of `sample` objects at each timestep, with the following fields, at a minimum:

- `t`: current time
- `rotation`: orientation of the entity
- `x`: x-coordinate of the entity's position in the world
- `y`: y-coordinate of the entity's position in the world

In addition to this data, each sample can also contain custom, user-defined time-series data.

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "t": 0,
            "rotation": 0,
            "x": 741.4686846915806,
            "y": 519.5448651348128
        },
        {
            "t": 28,
            "rotation": -0.3394931361149034,
            "x": 742.9471888602887,
            "y": 519.0227067075969
        },
        {
            "t": 44.29999999701977,
            "rotation": -0.3346741390403061,
            "x": 744.3460539036649,
            "y": 518.5410051854006
        }
    ],
    "lastTimeModified": {
        "_seconds": 1701914763,
        "_nanoseconds": 115000000
    }
}
```

## 4. `session-logs` collection

The documents in the `session-logs` collection contain an array of user-defined and framework-level log statements output from the entire experiment.

Each object in the array has the following information:

- `msg`: the actual message that was logged
- `type`: the type can be `log`, `warn`, or `error`, just like `console.log()` in javascript
- `clientTime`: the time on the client that this message was generated

Here is an example `session-logs` collection document:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "msg": [
                "load scene called with key: Wander Test"
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914760896
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "New wander scene created, logging state for agent: ",
                "agent"
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914760930
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "_angle = ",
                304.4683669002278
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914761924
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "_angle = ",
                363.9969997706003
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914762944
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "_angle = ",
                532.0378947698973
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914763946
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "load scene called with key: Wander Test_2"
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914771227
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "New wander scene created, logging state for agent: ",
                "agent_1"
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914771256
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "_angle = ",
                445.7914669163267
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914772219
        },
        {
            "msg": [
                "_angle = ",
                552.2095983980269
            ],
            "type": "log",
            "clientTime": 1701914773220
        }
    ],
    "time": {
        "_seconds": 1701914780,
        "_nanoseconds": 159000000
    }
}
```

## 5. `state-logs` collection

As the AI agents transition between states in a `PsyanimFSM` state machine, it is helpful for debugging and analysis purposes to keep track of the state changes.

The `state-logs` collection can optionally be generated for any trial, and it's data is autogenerated for developers & researchers.

Example JSON coming soon...

## 6. `jspsych-experiment-data` collection

The `jspsych-experiment-data` contains the contents of the `jsPsych.data` structure captured by any trial that had a `PsyanimJsPsychDataWriterExtension` added to it.

An example of this data looks like:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "jsPsychData": "[{\"rt\":424,\"stimulus\":\"<p style='text-align:center'>Welcome to the experiment.  Press any key to begin.</p>\",\"response\":\"enter\",\"trial_type\":\"html-keyboard-response\",\"trial_index\":0,\"time_elapsed\":425,\"internal_node_id\":\"0.0-0.0\"},{\"trial_type\":\"psyanim-jsPsych-plugin\",\"trial_index\":1,\"time_elapsed\":3698,\"internal_node_id\":\"0.0-1.0\"},{\"trial_type\":\"psyanim-jsPsych-plugin\",\"trial_index\":2,\"time_elapsed\":7188,\"internal_node_id\":\"0.0-2.0\"},{\"trial_type\":\"psyanim-jsPsych-plugin\",\"trial_index\":3,\"time_elapsed\":10759,\"internal_node_id\":\"0.0-3.0\"},{\"trial_type\":\"psyanim-jsPsych-plugin\",\"trial_index\":4,\"time_elapsed\":15287,\"internal_node_id\":\"0.0-4.0\"},{\"rt\":863,\"stimulus\":\"<p style='text-align:center'>Congrats - you have completed your first experiment!  Press any key to end this trial.</p>\",\"response\":\"enter\",\"trial_type\":\"html-keyboard-response\",\"trial_index\":5,\"time_elapsed\":16151,\"internal_node_id\":\"0.0-5.0\"}]",
        "sessionID": "bea6e389-5ae5-47f4-9235-4b221d8ff7f3",
        "userID": "Jason",
        "experimentName": "defaultExperimentName"
    },
    "time": {
        "_seconds": 1701914776,
        "_nanoseconds": 880000000
    }
}
```
